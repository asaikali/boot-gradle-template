# Spring Boot Gradle Template

**A Spring Boot Gradle template that “just works” from laptop to production.**

**This repository shows you how to create a Spring Boot project that “just works” from the moment you clone it.** You can import it into your IDE and run the main class, or simply execute `bootRun`—without the brittleness and frustration of wrestling with complex local configurations. Built on a philosophy of *convention over configuration*, it provides a clear structure for multi-module applications and a consistent development experience from local dev to production.
