# Spring Boot Gradle Template

**A Spring Boot Gradle template that “just works” from laptop to production.**

This repository shows you how to create a Spring Boot project that “just works” from the moment you clone it. You can import it into your IDE and run the main class, or simply execute `bootRun`—without the brittleness and frustration of wrestling with complex local configurations. Built on a philosophy of *convention over configuration*, it provides a clear structure for multi-module applications and a consistent development experience from local dev to production.

## Conventions

This template follows a set of conventions to ensure a predictable and consistent development experience:

**Project structure**  
Defines how applications, shared components, and platform code are organized.  
*Outcome: a predictable layout that makes it easy to navigate and extend the codebase.*  

**Local development**  
Establishes how developers run the project locally, including services like databases and message brokers.  
*Outcome: a consistent “clone and run” experience that works across all developer machines.*  

**Configuration management**  
Standardizes how application settings are defined and overridden for different environments.  
*Outcome: simple, reliable configuration from local development through production.*  

**Dependency management**  
Centralizes version control for all third-party libraries and plugins.  
*Outcome: consistent dependencies across modules and fewer version conflicts.*  

**Build and quality enforcement**  
Applies automated formatting, testing, and security checks during the build.  
*Outcome: a maintainable, high-quality codebase with fewer regressions.*  

**CI/CD pipelines**  
Defines how builds, tests, and deployments are automated in the pipeline.  
*Outcome: faster feedback and reliable releases without manual intervention.*  

**Documentation**  
Captures architectural decisions and module-specific information.  
*Outcome: shared context and easier onboarding for new team members.*  

**Modular and optimized builds**  
The modular structure and clear separation of responsibilities make builds faster and more reliable.  
*Outcome: support for parallel builds, better Gradle build caching, and incremental compilation for quicker feedback loops.*
